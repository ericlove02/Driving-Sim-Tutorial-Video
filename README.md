This project was created as a tutorial for a group of my friends who are learning how to code and wanted to attend a hackathon with me, but could not be on my team as it was already full. Instead, I created a YouTube tutorial for them to code along with and learn from during the event, that they used to reference and create their project. 

The tutorial is an hour and a half walk through on how to set up Unity and build a 3d game from scratch. The tutorial explains objects, colliders, scripting, animation, sound, and much more. In the end, views can create a fully working project where they can drive a car through a road and attempt to dodge obstacles. The tutorial was designed to allow for room for innovation and creativity by the user.
